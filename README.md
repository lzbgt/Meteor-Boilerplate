# Spark Boilerplate

This is Meteor Boilerplate. It is still under development.

## How to install

```
# Make sure you have meteor and meteorite are already installed
cd /path/to/project/
mrt install
meteor
```

## Packages used

* Jade 
* Stylus
* CoffeeScript
* Iron-router
* Iron-router-progress
* Laika (not involved yet)

## UI

Can be Bootstrap 3, Foundation or Semantic-UI

## Note

The files are loaded in alphabetical order, therefore you have to make sure the .jade files are before the .coffee files if you use same file name in the directory ...
My solution is to add _ in front of each jade file, which Meteor will load the .jade files first.
